Hi! I am Richard von DÃ¤niken Whale.

As a proud Kiwi I have been living in Switzerland since 2017. I have a broard professional background in financial, retail, radio broadcasting and tourism sectors. 

In 2021 I completed a Bacherlor in Business Administration majoring in Banking and Finance. I am now pursuing a career in providing value through financial analytics.

Becoming an accredited Charatered Financial Analyst in 2024 is a goal I am pursuing with stage 1 in 2023, and stage 2 and 3 in 2023. Prior to the CFA I wish to complete the Google analytics course in early 2023.
